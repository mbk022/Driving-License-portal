A Redesign of a driving license portal

The Driving Licence Portal is an essential web-based platform that facilitates driving license-related services online, eliminating the need for citizens to visit RTO offices, especially useful during the epidemic. This portal enables users to apply for, manage, and view their driving licenses from the comfort of their homes, making the process convenient and cost-effective. It also streamlines operations for the government by digitizing forms and documentation, reducing administrative costs.

The system comprises two main modules: User and Employee.

User Module:
Register and log in to the portal.
Apply for a Learner’s License (LLR).
Take the Learner’s License test online.
Change LLR details with OTP verification.
Book slots for the driving license test after passing the LLR test.
Change the address on their driving license.
View their driving license.
Employee Module:
Log in using government-provided credentials.
Enter applicant's LLR number and test date.
Award results after the driving license test.
This portal enhances service accessibility for citizens while optimizing resource use and efficiency for the government.
